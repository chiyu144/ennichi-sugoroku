Ennichi-Sugoroku is A Japanese summer festival theme web-based board game which allows 4 players to participate with a character. Players take turns in moving around a board based on the number of dice rolls, if someone lands on the “Goal” space first, then he / she wins. Also present on the board are "Event" spaces, which are roughly analogous to Monopoly's Chance and Community Chest spaces.
